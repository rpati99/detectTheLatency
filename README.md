# detectTheLatency

**[CodeGen resource](https://github.com/rpati99/timingMacro)**

*This Swift project aims to detect the execution of time of code upon user tap interaction with the SwiftUI elements.* 

The project is based on the approach of:- 

- Incorporating Static Analysis using SwiftSyntax to detect and extract desired code.

- Utilizing code generation methods using SwiftSyntaxBuilder to add time profiling code along with the extracted code.

- Integrate the code into the existing files into the iOS codebase. 

- CLI support
