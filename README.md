This Swift project aims to detect the execution of time of code upon user tap interaction with the SwiftUI elements. 

The project is based on the approach of:- (current status: Tentative)
1. Incorporating Static Analysis using SwiftSyntax to detect and extract desired code.
2. Utilizing code generation methods using SwiftSyntaxBuilder to add time profiling code along with the extracted code.
3. Integrate the code into the existing files into the iOS codebase. 
4. Build a macOS application that provides the visualization of the methods and the time it took respectively.
